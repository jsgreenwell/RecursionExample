# Recursion Example Code
Various demos for a lecture on 
recursion and design patterns.

## List of Examples
- Builder pattern (UserBuilder & Users)
- Several Typical Math Recursions
- Reversing a string with recursion
- Tree Traversal (RecursiveData)
  - note: this is minor point of lecture

> There was also an expectation of full completion of at least a computer science introductory course with some students having completed additional math, information systems, or software engineering courses. So the math concepts only received a cursory review, due to this course's focused on application development.
